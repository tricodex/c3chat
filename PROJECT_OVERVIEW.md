# C3Chat - AI Chat App Competition Entry

## Project Overview

C3Chat is an advanced AI chat application built to surpass T3 Chat's capabilities by addressing its pain points while introducing innovative features. We leverage Convex's real-time reactive database to eliminate the sync engine complexity that plagued T3 Chat, while providing instant UI updates and seamless multi-model AI integration.

## Local-First Architecture

Unlike T3 Chat's painful IndexDB implementation, C3Chat uses Convex's reactive system for true local-first experience:

1. **Instant UI Updates**: Optimistic mutations update UI immediately
2. **Real-time Sync**: Changes sync across devices in milliseconds
3. **Offline Support**: Queued actions execute when back online
4. **No Sync Bugs**: Server is the source of truth, no conflict resolution needed

## Development Status

- âœ… Core chat functionality
- âœ… Authentication system
- âœ… Thread management
- âœ… Message streaming
- ðŸš§ Multi-model support
- ðŸš§ File attachments
- ðŸš§ Advanced features

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local
# Add your API keys to .env.local

# Run development server
npm run dev
```

## Competition Strategy

We're building a better T3 Chat by:
1. **Solving Real Problems**: No more sync engine debugging
2. **Adding Requested Features**: Everything users wanted in T3 Chat
3. **Better Performance**: True real-time without loading states
4. **Developer Experience**: Simple, maintainable codebase
5. **Unique Features**: Chat branching, collaborative rooms, AI memory

This isn't just a clone - it's what T3 Chat should have been from the start.

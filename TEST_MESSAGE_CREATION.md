# Message Creation Debug

## Current Issue
Messages are not appearing in the chat after being sent. The UI shows "hi" multiple times but messages don't persist.

## Potential Problems:
1. API key validation failing
2. Messages being created locally but not syncing to Convex
3. Thread ID mismatch (temporary vs real)
4. AI action failing silently

## Next Steps:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify API keys are set in Settings
3. Test with a simple message without AI response

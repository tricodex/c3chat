# Performance Optimizations for Smooth UI Updates

## Issues Fixed

1. **Jittery Scrolling**: Messages were causing the page to jump up and down during updates
2. **Excessive Re-renders**: 2553 console logs in 5 seconds indicated too many state updates
3. **Viewport Cache Clearing**: Clearing viewport on every sync caused complete UI re-renders

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Debounced Message Sync (scalable-sync-engine-v2.tsx)
- Added 300ms debounce for Convex-to-Redis sync
- Prevents rapid viewport updates during message streaming
- Maintains UI responsiveness by updating memory immediately

### 2. Smart Scroll Management (ChatView.tsx)
- Added scroll debouncing (100ms) to prevent jittery auto-scroll
- Implemented scroll throttling (200ms) for viewport loading
- Uses `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth scroll operations
- Tracks previous message count to detect new messages accurately

### 3. Reduced Console Logging
- Removed verbose logging from production code
- Development-only duplicate ID checking
- Cleaner console output for better performance

### 4. Component Optimization (MessageList.tsx)
- Added `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Fixed message keys to use stable IDs instead of index
- Optimized duplicate checking to run only in development

### 5. Viewport Update Strategy
- No longer clears viewport during updates (smooth transitions)
- Compares message counts before syncing to avoid unnecessary updates
- Maintains existing viewport data on error instead of clearing

## Performance Improvements

- **Reduced Re-renders**: From hundreds per second to only when necessary
- **Smooth Scrolling**: No more jumping when messages arrive
- **Better State Management**: Debounced and throttled operations
- **Cleaner Console**: Minimal logging in production

## Testing

Run the performance tests:
```bash
bun test smooth-updates.test.ts
```

These optimizations ensure that:
1. Messages appear smoothly without UI jitter
2. Scroll position is maintained during updates
3. Redis sync doesn't cause visual disruptions
4. The app remains responsive during high-frequency updates

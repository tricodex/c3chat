# Message Rendering Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Light Mode Text Color Issue
**Problem**: User message text was showing as white in light mode
**Root Cause**: CSS in `/src/index.css` was forcing all user message text to be white with `!important`
**Fix**: Removed the problematic CSS rules, allowing theme-specific color variables to work properly

### 2. Messages from Different Chats Appearing Together
**Problem**: When switching between threads, messages from previous chats were still visible
**Root Cause**: Messages weren't being cleared when switching threads
**Fixes**:
- Added `CLEAR_THREAD_MESSAGES` action to the reducer
- Modified `selectThread` to clear previous thread messages before switching
- Added thread ID validation to ensure messages belong to current thread

### 3. Duplicate User Messages
**Problem**: User messages were appearing twice briefly
**Root Cause**: The AI action was creating a duplicate user message on the server while an optimistic message was already displayed
**Fixes**:
- Created new `generateResponse` action that doesn't create user messages
- Modified message sending flow to:
  1. Create optimistic message locally
  2. Create real message on server
  3. Remove optimistic message
  4. Generate AI response
- Added message deduplication using Map to prevent duplicate IDs

### 4. Message Sync and Rendering Stability
**Improvements**:
- Fixed infinite re-render loop by memoizing message IDs
- Improved message merging logic with proper deduplication
- Added tests to verify rendering behavior

# Redis Viewport Fix - Completed

## Issue Fixed
The Redis viewport was not updating when new messages arrived. Messages would only appear after a page reload.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Pipeline Execution Failing**: The Redis pipeline was failing due to improper command formatting
2. **Viewport Cache Not Cleared**: The viewport cache was not being invalidated when new messages arrived
3. **Thread Selection Issue**: Empty viewports were not being set when switching threads, causing stale data

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Redis Pipeline (redis-cache.ts)
- Replaced pipeline execution with direct Redis commands for reliability
- Clear viewport cache before syncing new messages
- Use proper zadd format with object arguments

### 2. Fixed Viewport Updates (scalable-sync-engine-v2.tsx)
- Clear viewport before loading fresh data after message sync
- Always set viewport on thread selection (even if empty)
- Clear viewport cache after sending messages
- Added delays to ensure Redis sync completes before loading

### 3. Reduced Console Logging
- Removed excessive debug logging that was causing 2500+ lines
- Only log when there's a message count mismatch
- Removed repetitive viewport loading logs

## Testing
- Created test scripts to verify Redis operations
- Confirmed messages are properly stored in Redis
- Verified viewport loading works correctly
- Messages now appear immediately without page reload

## Result
✅ Messages now appear in real-time without requiring page reload
✅ Viewport properly updates when switching threads
✅ Console logging reduced to reasonable levels
✅ Redis sync is working correctly with proper error handling

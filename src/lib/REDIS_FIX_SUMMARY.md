# Redis Viewport Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Message Format Parsing (✅ Fixed)
- **Problem**: Redis returns strings that need JSON parsing, but error handling was missing
- **Solution**: Added robust parsing with try-catch and type checking
- **Code**: Filter out null values after parsing failures

### 2. Race Condition (✅ Fixed) 
- **Problem**: Viewport loaded from Redis before messages were synced
- **Solution**: 
  - Added 100ms delay on thread selection to allow Convex query to start
  - Force viewport refresh after Redis sync completes
  - Added logging to track empty viewports

### 3. ID Type Conversion (✅ Fixed)
- **Problem**: Convex IDs are complex objects, Redis needs strings
- **Solution**: Force string conversion with `String(msg._id)` before storing in Redis

### 4. Debug Logging (✅ Added)
- Added comprehensive logging:
  - 🔍 getViewport calls
  - 📊 Message counts
  - ⚠️ Empty viewport warnings
  - 🔄 Sync operations
  - ✅ Success indicators

## Key Changes

### redis-cache.ts
1. Robust message parsing with error handling
2. Force string ID conversion in syncMessages
3. Immediate viewport refresh after sync
4. Comprehensive debug logging

### scalable-sync-engine-v2.tsx
1. 100ms delay on thread selection for Convex query
2. Viewport refresh after Redis sync completes
3. Better empty viewport handling
4. **Smart sync optimization** (✅ NEW):
   - Tracks last synced content per message
   - Only syncs when content changes significantly
   - Longer debounce (1s) for streaming messages
   - Prevents viewport refresh during active streaming
   - Clears old message tracking on thread switch

## Expected Behavior
1. Messages sync to Redis in background (non-blocking)
2. Viewport loads from Redis if available
3. Empty Redis viewports don't break the UI
4. Cross-tab sync works via Redis
5. Debug logs help trace any remaining issues
6. **No excessive Redis syncs during streaming** (✅ FIXED)

## Performance Improvements
- Streaming messages sync every 1s instead of 300ms
- Only syncs if content changes by >100 chars while streaming
- Finished messages sync immediately (streaming → stable)
- Memory cleanup when switching threads
